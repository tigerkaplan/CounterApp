1. Limit Bounds: Implement upper and lower bounds for counting, ensuring the counter doesn't exceed specified limits.
*  Set a maximum count limit of 100 and a minimum count limit of -50. Prevent counting beyond these bounds.
*  Allow users to specify a step value. Clicking "+" increases the counter by the specified step value  and clicking "-" decreases it by the same step.
2. Custom Increment/Decrement: Allow users to specify the amount by which the counter increments or decrements.
*  Add buttons to allow users to increment by 5 or decrement by 3 instead of the default
3. Time-based Increment:
*  Implement a feature where the counter increases automatically every second, simulating a timer.
4. Reset Functionality: Include a reset button to set the counter back to zero or any other specified starting point.
*  Implement a "Reset" button that sets the counter back to zero when clicked.
5. Styling and UI: Enhance the visual aspect of the app with CSS, making it more appealing and user-friendly.
*  Apply CSS styles to make the counter larger, change the font, or add a background colour to the counter area.
6. Animations: Add animations to the counter display to make counting more engaging.
*  Use CSS transitions or JavaScript animations to create a smooth counting effect when the number changes.
7. Persistent Storage: Save the counter's state to local storage or a database so that the count persists even if the user refreshes the page or revisits the app later.
*  Save the counter value to local storage so that even if the user closes the browser and reopens it, the count remains the same.
8. Multiple Counters: Enable the creation of multiple counters on the same page or allow users to create their own counters dynamically.
*  Allow users to dynamically create multiple counters with their own unique IDs, each functioning independently.
9. Sound Effects: Add sound effects or notifications for each increment or decrement to provide auditory feedback.
* Play a "ding" sound each time the counter increases or a "buzz" sound when it decreases.
10. Keyboard Controls: Implement keyboard shortcuts to allow users to increase or decrease the count using specific keys.
* Allow users to use the "+" and "-" keys on their keyboard to increment and decrement the counter.
11. Share Functionality: Enable users to share the current count via social media or other communication channels.
* Include a button to share the current count on social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.
12. Countdown Timer: Extend the functionality to include a countdown timer based on the counter logic.
* Enable users to set a specific count and initiate a countdown from that value.
13. Customizable Themes: Allow users to choose different themes or colour schemes for the counter.
* Implement a settings panel allowing users to select from predefined themes (light/dark mode, different colour schemes) for the counter app.
14. History Log:
*  Keep a log of all the increments and decrements made by the user, displaying the history in a list format.
15. Dynamic Limits:
*  Allow users to dynamically set upper and lower limits for the counter through input fields or sliders.
16. Counter with Labels:
*  Instead of just a number, display labels or units (e.g., "Count: 5 apples") to provide context for what the counter represents.
17. Multi-Mode Counter:
*  Create different modes for the counter (e.g., Counting, Timer, Scoreboard). Switch between these modes to change the counter's behaviour.
18. Remote Control:
*  Enable remote access to the counter so that multiple users can interact with it simultaneously.
19. Real-time Sync:
*  Implement real-time synchronization across devices, where changes made to the counter on one device are instantly reflected on others (using technologies like WebSocket).
20. Interval Counting:
*  Create buttons labelled "Start" and "Stop" to count at regular intervals (e.g., increment every 2 seconds) once the "Start" button is clicked.
21. Decimal Counter:
*  Modify the counter to handle decimal numbers, allowing for fractional counting.
22. Colour-changing Counter:
*  Change the colour of the counter text dynamically based on its value. For instance, turn the text red when the count is negative.
23. Voice-controlled Counter:
*  Incorporate voice recognition to allow users to verbally increase or decrease the count.
